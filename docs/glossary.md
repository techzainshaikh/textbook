# Glossary

This glossary contains key terms and definitions used throughout the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## A

**Action** - A ROS 2 communication pattern for sending goals to a server and receiving feedback and results.

**AI Robot Brain** - The intelligent processing unit of a robot that handles perception, decision making, and planning.

## C

**Control Architecture** - The system design that manages how a robot processes sensor data and generates motor commands.

## D

**Digital Twin** - A virtual representation of a physical robot used for simulation and testing.

## E

**End-Effector** - The device at the end of a robotic arm designed to interact with the environment.

## G

**Gazebo** - A 3D simulation environment for robotics that provides realistic physics simulation.

## H

**Humanoid Robot** - A robot with physical features that resemble the human body structure.

## I

**Isaac Sim** - NVIDIA's robotics simulation environment for developing and testing AI-powered robots.

## K

**Kinematics** - The study of motion without considering the forces that cause the motion.

## L

**Learning Objectives** - Measurable outcomes that students should achieve after completing a chapter or module.

## M

**Module** - A major section of the textbook containing related chapters on a specific topic.

## N

**Node** - A ROS process that performs computation. Nodes are combined together into a ROS system.

## P

**Perception Pipeline** - A sequence of processing steps that transforms sensor data into meaningful information.

## R

**ROS 2** - Robot Operating System 2, a flexible framework for writing robotic software.

**ROS 2 Control** - The framework for controlling robot hardware in ROS 2.

## S

**Service** - A ROS 2 communication pattern that allows nodes to request specific computations from other nodes.

**Sim-to-Real Transfer** - The process of transferring learned behaviors or models from simulation to real robots.

## T

**Topic** - A ROS 2 communication pattern that allows nodes to exchange messages through publish-subscribe communication.

## U

**URDF** - Unified Robot Description Format, an XML format for representing a robot model.

## V

**Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Systems that integrate visual perception, language understanding, and physical action.

## W

**What/Why Comments** - Code comments that explain both what the code does (WHAT) and the reasoning behind the implementation (WHY).
