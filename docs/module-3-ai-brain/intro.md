# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Implement perception systems using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS
- Design planning and decision-making systems for humanoid robots
- Integrate machine learning models for robotic tasks
- Understand sim-to-real transfer techniques
- Apply reinforcement learning for robot control

## Prerequisites

Students should have:
- Understanding of basic machine learning concepts
- Completion of Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals) and Module 2 (Digital Twin)
- Knowledge of computer vision fundamentals
- Familiarity with neural networks and deep learning basics

## Core Concepts

Module 3 focuses on the artificial intelligence layer of our humanoid robot system. This module teaches students how to implement perception, planning, and learning systems that enable robots to understand their environment, make decisions, and adapt their behavior.

### NVIDIA Isaac Ecosystem

The NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem provides:
- Isaac Sim: Photorealistic simulation environment
- Isaac ROS: Hardware-accelerated perception pipelines
- Isaac Lab: Reinforcement learning and imitation learning frameworks
- Isaac Apps: Reference applications for common robotics tasks

### Perception Systems

Modern robotics perception systems include:
- Visual perception (object detection, segmentation, pose estimation)
- Spatial perception (SLAM, mapping, localization)
- Multimodal perception (fusion of different sensor modalities)
- Semantic perception (understanding scene meaning and context)

### Planning and Decision Making

Robotic planning encompasses:
- Path planning (finding collision-free trajectories)
- Task planning (sequencing high-level actions)
- Motion planning (generating feasible movements)
- Reactive planning (adapting to dynamic environments)

## Implementation

In this module, we'll implement AI-powered perception and decision-making capabilities for our humanoid robot, focusing on NVIDIA Isaac technologies for accelerated development.

## Examples
