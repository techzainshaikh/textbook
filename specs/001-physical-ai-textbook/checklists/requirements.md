**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-19
**Feature**: specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Note: Technology stack details are part of non-negotiable requirements, not implementation choices
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - Note: Technology requirements are specified as non-negotiable constraints
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Note: Technology stack is part of requirements, not implementation
